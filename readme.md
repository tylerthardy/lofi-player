# Lofi-Player
## What is it?
An **electron** desktop application to listen to `lofi hiphop radio - beats to relax/study to` by Lofi Girl ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A)).

Created because opening it in a browser would overlap with tabs used for other purposes (i.e. work).

Create a release pipeline and serve the exe through GitHub
